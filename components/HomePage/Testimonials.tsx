      "Partnering with Cognition IES for our plant’s digital transformation has been a game-changer. From the very beginning, their team demonstrated a deep understanding of both engineering and digital technologies. The precision laser scanning helped us uncover layout inconsistencies. The digital twin they built is not just a model — it’s a dynamic tool that gives us real-time visibility into our operations. We’ve seen significant improvements in our decision-making, reduced downtime, and far fewer issues during equipment installation and changeovers. Their implementation of an evergreen strategy ensures that our digital systems evolve with us. The training and support provided to our staff were exceptional — even our most experienced operators quickly adapted to the new tools. Cognition IES didn’t just deliver a service; they’ve empowered us with a smarter, scalable way to run our facility. This project laid the foundation for Industry 4.0 in our plant, and we’re already planning the next phase with them.",
